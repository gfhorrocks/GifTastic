GIPHY API Interaction
 
GifTastic is a javascript based website that queries the GIPHY API for data.

Theme of the initial GiF buttons is Video Games.  Clicking on a game will query GIPHY for 10 random GiFs and display them in still frame.  Underneath each GiF is the rating, provided by the GIPHY API.  

G,PG,PG-13,R are the ratings and they go from least adult to most adult content.

Clicking on one of these generated still images will start the animated image.  Clicking again will return to it's still state.

You may enter a new string value in the "Add a Game" input field and hit (enter) or click "Submit"

Reloading the page will clear the user inputted buttons and just display the original list.
